Write a Figure interface and an abstract Quadrangle class. Figure should have the following methods:
---
double area();
double perimeter().
---

The Quadrangle should have:
---
integer variable a - side a (sides);
an integer variable b - side b (bottom and top sides);
a string variable color;
a constructor taking all these values (int a, int b, String color);
abstract method getLargeDiagonal(), which returns a real (double) number - the large diagonal;
the abstract getHeight() method, which returns a real (double) number - the height of the quadrilateral;
the abstract getColor() method, which returns a string - color.
---

Create classes that should be descendants of the Quadrangle class and implement the Figure interface; for each class, implement finding its perimeter, area, diagonal, height.
Create the classes listed below...

Square (square):
---
must have a constructor that takes values (int a, String color), side b = a;
method getLargeDiagonal() returns double - the diagonal of the square (you have to calculate);
method getColor() returns a string - color;
method getHeight() returns double - the height of the square (just a);
the getArea() method returns double - the area of the square;
The getPerimeter() method returns double - the perimeter of the square.
---

Rectangle:
---
Must be a constructor that takes values (int a int b, String color);
The getLargeDiagonal() method returns double - the diagonal of the rectangle (you can use Math.sqrt() and Math.max() for this);
method getColor() returns a string - color;
the getHeight() method returns double - the smaller height of the rectangle (this is either a or b);
 the getArea() method returns double - the area of the rectangle;
 The getPerimeter() method returns double - the perimeter of the rectangle.
---

Rhombuses:
---
A real variable (double) alpha (the lower left corner of the rhombus, in degrees).
a real variable (double) beta (upper left corner of the rhombus, in degrees).
there must be a constructor that takes values (int a, double alpha, double beta, String color), b = a.
method getLargeDiagonal() returns double - the greater diagonal of the rhombus (formulas are online, to use the trigonometric function, use Math.cos() or Math.sin(), to convert degrees to radians, use Math.toRadians());
The getColor() method returns a string - color;
the getHeight() method returns double - the height of the rhombus;
The getArea() method returns double - the area of the diamond;
The getPerimeter() method returns double - the perimeter of the rhombus.
---

Parallelogram:
---
A real variable (double) alpha (the lower left corner of the parallelogram in degrees);
real variable (double) beta (the upper left corner of the parallelogram in degrees);
there must be a constructor that takes values (int a, int b, double alpha, double beta, String color);
method getLargeDiagonal() returns double - the large diagonal of the parallelogram (formulas are online, to use the trigonometric function, use Math.cos() or Math.sin());
The getColor() method returns a string - color;
the getHeight() method returns double - the LOWER height of the parallelogram;
the getArea() method returns double - the area of the parallelogram;
the getPerimeter() method returns double - the perimeter of the parallelogram.

You passed 100% of all tests.

Took a few tries but 65% of the code was written right.
35% off because the formulae were different in the answer compared to the ones that I have found.
