Write an abstract Player class. In it create:
---
integer variable hp - health;
integer variable level - level;
string variable type - player class;
string variable weapon - player's weapon;
constructor taking parameters (hp, level, type, weapon);
an abstract method that returns the string getFullInfo();
an abstract method without the return value of levelUp();
an abstract method that returns the boolean value doDamage().

Create a Wizard class and inherit it from the Player class. Create in it:
---
an integer variable manaLevel - mana level;
a string variable element - the wizard's element;
implement a constructor that takes parameters (hp, level, type, weapon, manaLevel, element);
implement method levelUp(), when you call it, the variable level should increase by 1;
Implement getFullInfo() method, which will return a string with all parameters separated by spaces in order: hp, level, type, weapon, manaLevel, element;
Implement a method doDamage(), which when manaLevel >= 10 will decrease manaLevel by 10 units and return true, and when manaLevel < 10 will return false.

Create a Warrior class and inherit it from the Player class. Here you should create:
---
a string variable armor - warrior's armor;
Implement a constructor that takes parameters (hp, level, type, weapon, armor);
Implement method levelUp(), when you call it the variable Level should increase by 1;
Implement getFullInfo() method, which will return a string with all parameters separated by spaces in order: hp, level, type, weapon, armor.
Implement method doDamage(), which will return true when called.
