Write an abstract Transport class. It must have:
- an integer field fuel;
- an integer field speed;
- a constructor that accepts fuel and speed;
- an abstract method canMove(int n), which returns a logical (boolean) value - whether the vehicle can travel n kilometers;
- abstract method getFuelLevel(), which returns an integer - the fuel level.

Write a class Car which is a descendant of the Transport class and has:
- an integer field maxPassengers - the maximum number of passengers;
- a constructor that takes fuel, speed, maxPassengers;
- getFuelLevel() method which returns an integer number - fuel;
- method canMove(int n), should return true if fuel >= n and reduce fuel level by n, otherwise return false;
- getMaxPassenger() method, which returns an integer - the maximum number of passengers.

Write a Plane class which is a descendant of the Transport class and has:
- a constructor that takes fuel, speed;
- getFuelLevel() method that returns fuel;
- method canMove(int n) should return true if fuel >= n, and - reduce fuel level by n, otherwise return false;
- method fillFuel(int n), which returns nothing, but increases fuel level by n.
